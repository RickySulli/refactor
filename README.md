# refactor project

This was the assignment for module 1 in the class for coding bootcamp thru UT HTML CSS Git Challenge sources.bootcampspot.com
I had a serious problem getting the first version of this to github.
The source path got all messed.
After trying to fix it for several hours I decided to delete and start over.  
this worked after only a couple of hours.
this is why you aren't seeing as many commits as you may expected to see.
